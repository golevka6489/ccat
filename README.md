# custom cat (ccat)
entirely vibe-coded by gemini (sorry)\
basically a fork of "cat" that displays bold red filename headers between output of concatenated files\
i have no idea how to program anything\

version history:\
00 - it works\
01 - red bold filenames\

future plans:\
02 - filename-only header (not the full directory)\
